			<h2>ME</h2>
			<p>I'm Jason! I'm currently an aspiring Full Stack Software Developer studying at Northcoders.
				<br /><br />
				Prior to Northcoders, I spent over 10 years building toward a career in Financial Services, specifically Wealth Management. 2020: Covid-19 hit and shook both the world and me. I quickly realised I needed more from life than to sell financial products to the public. 
				<br /><br />
				I have had a technical mind since I was young; long been obsessed with the quick change of pace of new technologies and fascinated with how they can both huge advantages and disadvantages. Coding has changed the world in so many ways, both good and bad. This is a conversation I needed to be a part of desperately, hence the career change.
				<br /><br />
				Whilst currently studying with Northcoders as a Junior Developer, I will continue my learning and hope of being at the forefront of innovation and new technologies to leave things in a better state than when I found them.
				<br /><br />
				Besides software development, I have a keen interest in working on both my mind and body by immersing myself in podcasts and working out on a regular basis, and experimenting with vegan recipes where possible. Other than that, I can be found supporting Drag Queens, playing around with amateur photography and cuddling my boxer dog, Nelly!</p>
