			<h2>Me</h2>
			<p>
				I'm Jason! I'm currently an aspiring Full Stack Software Developer
				studying at Northcoders.
				<br /><br />
				Prior to Northcoders, I spent over 10 years building toward a career in
				Financial Services, specifically Wealth Management. 2020: Covid-19 hit
				and shook both the world and me. I quickly realised I needed more from
				life than to sell financial products to the public.
				<br /><br />
				I have had a technical mind since I was young; long been obsessed with
				the quick change of pace of new technologies and fascinated with how
				they can both huge advantages and disadvantages. Coding has changed the
				world in so many ways, both good and bad. This is a conversation I
				needed to be a part of desperately, hence the career change.
				<br /><br />
				Whilst currently studying with Northcoders as a Junior Developer, I will
				continue my learning and hope of being at the forefront of innovation
				and new technologies to leave things in a better state than when I found
				them.
				<br /><br />
				Besides software development, I have a keen interest in working on both
				my mind and body by immersing myself in podcasts and working out on a
				regular basis, and experimenting with vegan recipes where possible.
				Other than that, I can be found supporting Drag Queens, playing around
				with amateur photography and cuddling my boxer dog, Nelly!
